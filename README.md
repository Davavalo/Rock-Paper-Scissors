I wanted to master CSS Grid better for this project, so I primarily focused on utilizing a grid structure throughout my design. I also focused on using mobile-first design. I began coding the design on a mobile screen and worked my way up to desktop size. 

Things I learned: 
<ul>
 <li> When to use a switch statement vs an if-else statement </li>
 <li> How to create a mobile-first responsive design </li>
 <li> How to better use CSS Grid </li>
 <li> How to create a simple interactive game using css, html, and js</li>
